# The feasible region is the region enclosed by the curves y=mx+b
# y=nx+a, x=0, and y=0. The variables are set up so that the 
# intersection of the two curves y=mx+b and y=nx+a is (k,mk+b).
# The slope of y=mx+b is positive and the slope of y=nx+a is negative.
# q, which is the slope of the level curves, is positive and less than n.
# The objective function is p = -qx+y.
# Therefore the min occurs at (-b/m,0) and the max at (k,mk+b).

BEGIN_TEXT
Consider the following problem:
\[\begin{array}{rcl} p&=&-$q x+ y \\ 
y - $m x &\leq& $b \\
y - $n x &\leq& $a \\
x &\geq& 0\\
y &\geq& 0 \end{array}
\]
Find the maximum and minimum values of p by graphing the feasible region in the Cartesian plane and by examining p at the vertex points. 
$BR
(a) The maximum value of p in the feasible region is \{ ans_rule(10) \}
$BR
(a) The minimum value of p in the feasible region is \{ ans_rule(10) \}
