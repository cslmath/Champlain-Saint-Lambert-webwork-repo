WW Authoring (for 201-901) - TODO notes

## Directory Structure

**Goal**: A common directory structure so that I can just tar zip files on theta and transfer to a WW course.

I want it to play nice with my current 901, my sandbox, theta, a model 901.  Looking forward it should make transfering template assignments as easy as possible once the files are transfered to CPL.

So the structure should look like:
Template_201-901/BusinessStatistics/ ...
or
Template_201-901/Statistics/ ...
or
Template_201-901/Labs/Lab06 ...
