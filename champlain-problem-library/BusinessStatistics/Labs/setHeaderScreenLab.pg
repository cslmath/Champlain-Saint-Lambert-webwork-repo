This is the WeBWorK part of ${BBOLD}Lab Assignment $setNumber${EBOLD}.
It is due on : ${BBOLD}$formatedDueDate${EBOLD}.

$PAR
This is where you do the WeBWorK part of your lab using your group login.
$PAR
To do the questions you will have to refer to the instructions downloaded from Lea and the Excel sheet also found on Lea.
$PAR
Only one student at a time can use your group login.  If another memebr of the group logs in the first student is automatically logged out.

The primary purpose of WeBWorK is to let you know if you are getting the right answer or to alert you if you get the wrong answer.
For questions with numeric answers, you can usually attempt a problem as many times as you want before the due date.
However, if you are having trouble figuring out your error, you should
consult the notes, or ask a fellow student or
your teacher for help.  Don't spend a lot of time guessing -- it's not very efficient or effective.
$PAR
For multiple choice or true or false questions, usually the number of attempts will be limited to discourage guessing.
$PAR
For numerical answers, if you are sure that your answer is correct, but WeBWorK is telling you that it is wrong, try increasing the precision of your answer.  If you are entering your answer with no fractional part, try entering one or two decimal palces.  If you are already entering one or two decimals, increase the number of decimal places to four or five.
