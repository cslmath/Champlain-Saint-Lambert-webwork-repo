BEGIN_PGML
A container is to have the shape of a right circular cylinder with radius [` x `] cm and height [` y `] cm and a volume of  [$V]  cm[`^3`]. Suppose also that the material for the circular base costs  [$pb]  cents per square centimetre, the material for the circular top costs  [$pt]  cents per square centimetre, and the material for the side of the container costs  [$ps]  cents per square centimetre.

Find the dimensions of the container that will minimize the cost of material and
find the minimum cost. Justify your conclusion by answering
the following questions.

a) To solve this problem, we need to minimize the cost (in *dollars*) as a function of the radius [` x `]:  
Cost [` C(x) = `][________________________________________]{$Cx} dollars

b) Give the domain of [` C(x) `] in interval notation.  (Use the fact that length must be positive.)  
Domain: [_______________]{Interval(0,inf)}

c) The function [` C(x) `] has a critical point at [`x = c_1`] where:  
[` c_1 = `] [_______________]{$xcrit}

d) To verify that [` C(x) `] has a minimum at this critical point, we evaluate the second derivative [` C''(x) `] at [`x=c_1`]:  
[` C''(c_1)`] is [______________]{$Cppxcrit}, which is a positive number. (Thus, the function [` C(x) `] is concave upward at this point.)

e) In conclusion, the dimensions of the container that minimizes the cost and the minimum cost (in *dollars*) are:  
Radius [`x `] = [_______________]{$xcrit} cm  
Height [`y `] = [_______________]{$ycrit} cm  
Minimum cost =  [_________________________]{$Cmin} dollars.  
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
1. Area of the side of the container = (circumference)(height) = ([` 2 \pi `] radius)(height).
2. Volume of a right circular cylinder = (area of base)(height) = ([`\pi`] radius[`^2`])(height).
3. Remember to convert the cost of the material from cents to *dollars*.
END_PGML_HINT

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
a) The cost as a function of the radius [` x`] and height [`y`] is:  
Cost = [`[$Cxy]`]  
The volume of the container is [$V] cubic centimetres: [` \pi x^2 y = [$V]`], which gives [` y = \frac{[$V]}{\pi x^2}`].  
Substituting this expression for [`y`] in the cost gives the cost function in terms of the radius [`x`] only.  
Thus, the function to minimize is:  
Cost [` C(x) `] = [`[$Cx]`] 

b) The domain is [`(0,\infty)`].

c) [`C'(x) = [$Cxp] = 0`]. Solving [`C'(x)=0`] gives [` x = c_1 = [$xcrit]`] as the critical point. (Note that [`x=0`] is not a critical point, since it is not in the domain of [`C(x)`].)

d) [`C''(x) = [$Cxpp]`]. Evaluating the second derivative at the critical point gives
[`C''(c_1)= C''([$xcrit]) = [$Cppxcrit]`], which is a positive number. 

e) In conclusion, the dimensions of the container that minimize the cost are:  
- Radius [`x=[$xcrit]`] cm  
- Height [`y=[$ycrit]`] cm  
- Minimum cost is [`[$Cmindisp]`]
