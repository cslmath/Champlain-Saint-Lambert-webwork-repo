BEGIN_TEXT
This summer, you have started you own lawn mowing company. In order to start your
 business, you had to buy three lawn mowers and T-shirts labeled with the company
 name for the three employees you had to hire. The three lawn mover were purchased at $250 and the T-shirts for $75 ($25 each). When the summer started, you had lawn mowing contracts for
 20 lawns. The contracts were over a 10-week period and the lawns had to be mowed
 once every two weeks. So each contract required mowing the lawn five times over
 the summer. Now each time a lawn was mowed, you had to pay $$costgasoline for
 the gasoline and
 $$costemployee for your employee. Hence the cost of mowing a lawn was
 $$costofmowinglawn. You had set a
 price of $20 for mowing a lawn (therefore each contract generated revenues of
 $100 over the summer). This means that over the summer, you made a profit of
 $$profitfirstsummer (can you see why?).
$PAR
This summer, you want to operate your business again and obtain contracts for 
mowing lawn under the same conditions (once every two weeks over a 10-week period).
 Obviously, you do not need to buy the lawn mowers again (so their cost will not
 be part of your fixed costs this summer). However, they will need some servicing and that
 will cost you $200. You still expect to hire the same three employees and you
 will need 3 new T-shirts (at the same price as last year).  Your experience
 from last summer has given you some knowledge about the lawn mowing market. You 
believe that at a price of $20 for mowing a lawn, you will still have 20 clients.
 You estimate that a rebate of $1 in the price charged (each time a lawn is mowed)
 will increase the number of clients (or contracts) by $a for the summer. For 
example, if you charge $18 for mowing a lawn (each two weeks), you will obtain
 \(20+ 2\cdot $a = $newx\) clients. Similarly, if you increase the price by $2 dollars,
 you will obtain  \(20- 2\cdot $a = $newx2 \) clients. 
$PAR
(a) Give the details of the calculations involved to deduce that a profit of $ 
$profitfirstsummer was made last summer. Submit a hard copy for your solution.
$BR
(b) The elasticity of demand when the numbers of clients (lawns to mow) is 20 is
\{ ans_rule(6) \}. This means that when the price of mowing a lawn is increased by
1 percent, the number of clients decreases by \{ ans_rule(6) \} percent.
$BR
(c) Does the elasticity of demand when the numbers of clients is 20 suggests to increase
 or decrease the price charged for mowing lawns in order to maximize your revenues? Explain.
Submit a hard copy for your explanation.
$BR
(d) In order to maximize your revenues, you should charge \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars to mow a lawn and the number of clients should be
 \{ ans_rule(6) \}. Each client should be charged
 \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars for the entire summer (the price of their contract). The
 revenues generated will be of \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars and the profit will be of  \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars.
$BR
(e) In order to maximize your profits, you should charge \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars to mow a lawn and the number of clients should be
 \{ ans_rule(6) \}. Each client should be charged
 \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars for the entire summer (the price of their contract). The
 profits generated will be of \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars and the revenue will be of  \{ ans_rule(6) \} dollars.

SOLUTION(EV3(<<'END_SOLUTION'));
$PAR SOLUTION $PAR

During the first summer, the revenues are 20 clients \(\times\)  20 dollars \(\times\) 5 = 2000 dollars.
The costs are 250 + 75 + 5 \(\times\) $costofmowinglawn \(\times\) 20 = $costfirstsummer  dollars. 
Therefore the profit made during the first summer is $profitfirstsummer dollars. 

$PAR
Since the demand function, which we assume to be linear, goes through the
points (20,20) and ($newx,18), then 
\[p = -1/$a x + $yint,\]
where p is the unit price for mowing a lawn and x is the number of clients.
Therefore
\[x = f(p) = -$a p + $yint2,\]
and \(f'(p) = -$a\).
The elasticity of demand is
\[E(p) = \frac{$a p}{-$a p + $yint2},\]
and \(E(20) = $a\). This means that an increase of 1% of the unit price
decreases demand by $a %. Since \($a>1\), it is necessary to decrease the price charged in order to maximize the revenue (the demand is elastic).
$PAR
To maximize the revenue function, we express R as a function of x (we could 
also have chosen to express R as a function of p). We get
\[R(x) = 5x(-1/$a x + $yint) = -5x^2/$a + $yint5 x.\]
Clearly, R is a concave down parabola (the leading coefficient is negative) and 
therefore it is maximized where the derivative is zero. Since
\[R'(x) = $coeff1 x + $coeff2\]
then solving \(R'(x) = 0\) 
gives \(x = $optimal_demand_revenue\) clients. We calculate the unit price to cut a 
lawn by replacing this value of x in \(p = -1/$a x + $yint\). Therefore we 
obtain that the revenue is maximized with a value of $optimal_revenue dollars if we have $optimal_demand_revenue clients 
and if the price charged for cutting a lawn is $optimal_priceperlawn_revenue dollars. 
Each client should be charged $optimal_pricecontract_revenue dollars for the entire summer. 
$PAR
The profit function is P(x) = R(x) - C(x). During the second summer
\[C(x) = 275 + $costofmowinglawn x.\]
Hence
\[P(x) = -5x^2/$a + $yint5 x - 275 - $costofmowinglawn x = -5x^2/$a + $coeff2 x -275.\]
Therefore profit made when the revenue is maximized is 
\[P($optimal_demand_revenue ) = $profit_optimalrevenue \]
dollars (if the above quantity is negative, we are loosing money). 
$PAR
Since P is a concave down parabola, once again the maximum profit is obtained
by equating its derivative to zero. Since
\[P'(x) = $coeff1 x + $coeff2,\]
then \(P'(x) = 0\) if \(x=$optimal_demand_profit\). Therefore, profit is
maximized with a value of $optimal_profit dollars if we have $optimal_demand_profit clients and charge  $optimal_priceperlawn_profit dollars
 to mown a lawn. Each client should be charged 
$optimal_pricecontract_profit dollars for the entire summer. The revenues obtained in 
this case are $revenue_optimalprofit dollars.
