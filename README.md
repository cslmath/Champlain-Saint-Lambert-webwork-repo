Champlain-Saint-Lambert-webwork-repo

This is the Champlain-Saint-Lambert-webwork-repo. Here you will find WeBWorK problems contributed by the Champlain Saint-Lambert math department as well as set definition files for the template assignments by topic for the model courses.

This repository has three parts:

    1) champlain-problem-library
    2) CPL-Contrib
    3) Course-Templates

1) champlain-problem-library:
The contents of champlain-problem-library are the problems one can browse via the Library Browser in WeBWorK by clicking on the Champlain button and browsing through dropdown menus**(see the file Dropdown-Menu.md). While this entire repository is named Champlain-Saint-Lambert-webwork-repo, we will use CPL to refer to just the part called champlain-problem-library.

2) CPL-Contrib:
New contributions should go into CPL-Contrib in a subdirectory whose prefix is the contributors initials, 

> e.g. JD-Contrib/ contains Jane Doe's contributions.

The original contributors retain control of these files, both in style and content. Problems are automatically considered for being added to the CPL unless the contributor specifically asks that they not be. So, this can be an avenue for sharing WeBWorK problems with the Champlain community exactly as the author has created them.

3) Course-Templates:
For each model course (e.g., model201-NYA), there is a corresponding subdirectory containing the set definition files for its template assignments by topic. These template assignments are usually loaded when a course is first created at the beginning of the semester. The template assignments can be used directly as assignments or as a starting point for creating new assignments.
